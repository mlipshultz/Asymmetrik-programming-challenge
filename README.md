# Asymmetrik Programming Challenge 
Business Card OCR by Matt Lipshultz

## Requirements:
Must have Python 3. I used 3.6, however any stable version of python 3 should work.

## Instructions:
Open a terminal and navigate to the folder where the code is located. Type "python business_card_parser.py *Filename*"
where *Filename* is the location of the file you wish to parse. The file should be a .txt file, each line containing
a line from the business card. I have included the example .txt files.
